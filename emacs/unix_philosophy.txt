The Unix Philosophy

From the UNIX Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighanand Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and tehniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at it's heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
